## Contributing

The project is utilising next.js and global styling in a global.css file. There is no css written other than body and a tags. The folder structure is simple with all pages in a folder with the same name, that can be found in the root of the project, and contains folders for each page on the site. All the page folders contain an index.js file where the main code for that page is found. In the pages/people folder there is also a [id].js file which is used to fetch the id’s from the api. The pages/api folder contains hello.js and a folder called auth. In the pages/api/auth folder there is a […nextauth].js file where the providers for the nextAuth is added.

In the root of the project you will also find a components folder which contains two folders.
The components/form folder contains a folder called validation with a file called loginSchema.js which is for validation and error messages when logging in. components/form also contains three files. FormLabel.js wich is for the labels in the form. InputField.js wich is for the input fields in the form. And LoginForm.js which is the form itself.
The components/header folder is the second folder inside components and contains an index.js file which is the code for the header and exports the header component so we can use it in the pages.
